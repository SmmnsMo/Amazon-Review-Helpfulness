# Amazon-Review-Helpfulness
This project dives into what makes Amazon reviews helpful and creates a Natural Language classifier to predict if reviews are helpful or not.

## Data Acquisition and Cleaning
The data was downloaded from https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html

Data acquisition and cleaning are split up into two steps: Data Wrangling and Data Cleaning.
Data Wrangling a sample from each dataset and merges each sample with their respective metadata.
The Data Cleaning step takes the samples and consolidates all of them into a single file - cleaning and making all columns consistent with one another.
